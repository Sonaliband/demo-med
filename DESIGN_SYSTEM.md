# MEDINTEL design system

Visual thesis: an elegant clinical journal becomes an interactive research workspace. The supplied reference is inspiration, not a page background. Original generated edge artwork is used with digitally recreated surfaces and spacing.

## Reference analysis
- Palette: ivory paper, pale lavender, powder blue, periwinkle, muted botanical green. Ink is deliberately darker for reading and controls.
- Composition: quiet central content; decorative weight at opposing corners; generous negative space.
- Decoration: restrained botanical leaves and one butterfly. Never cover controls or medical text.
- Hierarchy: large editorial headline, concise supporting text, clear primary action; compact utility labels.
- Texture: translucent watercolor washes, subtle paper grain and glass surfaces.
- Spacing: 8px base, 16–24px component gaps, 32–48px workspace margins, 64–96px narrative sections.
- Typography: Playfair Display for journal headings; DM Sans for body, forms and controls; Georgia/system sans fallbacks.
- Lighting: diffuse, broad highlights and soft lavender shadows; restrained depth.

## Module identities
- Landing: open botanical margins, editorial introduction, one clinical network and a seven-step narrative.
- My Case: numbered journal fields and supporting attachments.
- Similar Cases: network canvas and a focused comparison panel.
- Trends: cool atlas surface, geographic globe, region detail and time-series chart.
- Research: paper-like cards and a quiet long-form reading view.
- Saved Research: the same reading system with a personal collection state.
- Profile/Auth: sparse forms with botanical framing.

## Motion and accessibility
CSS reveals and hover elevation are restrained. Network motion explains relationships; globe rotation explains geography. The system reduced-motion preference and saved preference should stop autonomous motion. Every visualization has text controls or an accessible alternative. Shadcn/Radix primitives provide dialogs, selects, tabs and sidebar keyboard behavior.
